Java For Each Loop

For-Each Loop
There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively 
to loop through elements in an array:

for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}

String[] Topics = {"C", "C++", "Java", "Python"};
for (String i : Topics) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
